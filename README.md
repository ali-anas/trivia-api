# Full Stack API Project

## Full Stack Trivia

A bunch of team members got the idea to hold trivia on a regular basis and created a  webpage to manage the trivia app and play the game, but their API experience is limited and still needs to be built out. 

That's where you come in! Help them finish the trivia app so they can start holding trivia and seeing who's the most knowledgeable of the bunch. The application:

1) Display questions - both all questions and by category. Questions shows the question, category and difficulty rating by default and can show/hide the answer. 
2) Delete questions.
3) Add questions and require that they include question and answer text.
4) Search for questions based on a text query string.
5) Play the quiz game, randomizing either all questions or within a specific category. 

Completing this trivia app give me the ability to structure plan, implement, and test an API 

## Tasks


1. [`./frontend/`](./frontend/README.md)
2. [`./backend/`](./backend/README.md)
 

### Backend

The `./backend` directory contains a partially completed Flask and SQLAlchemy server. You will work primarily in app.py to define your endpoints and can reference models.py for DB and SQLAlchemy setup. 


[View the README.md within ./frontend for more details.](./frontend/README.md)
